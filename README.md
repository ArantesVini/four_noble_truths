# Four Noble Truths in C++

This repository contains a simple C++ program that defines a class `FourNobleTruths` and prints the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism.

## Code Overview

The `FourNobleTruths` class has four public member variables: `dukkha`, `samudaya`, `nirodha`, and `magga`, each representing one of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism.

The class has a constructor that initializes these member variables with the corresponding truths.

The `printTruths` member function prints the Four Noble Truths to the console.

The `main` function creates an instance of `FourNobleTruths` and calls `printTruths` to print the truths.

## Running the Code

To compile and run the code, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ FourNobleTruths.cpp -o FourNobleTruths
./FourNobleTruths
```

## Why?

This code was inspired by a Dharma speech I was listening to while coding. I got curious and decided to represent the Four Noble Truths in C++.
